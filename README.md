## by (Dominic Nyoni)


## Dataset

The investigation made use of the TMDb movie data set. The TMDb data set contains 10000 movies from the The Movies Database(TMDb) which includes user ratings and revenue.The dataset and the data dictionary were sourced from https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/July/

## Project Structure

There are two files which both contain the same info only that one is in html format while the other is a ipynb file.The files contain my analysis of the TMBD dataset and my findings about it.

## What do i need to install?

This project uses Python 3 and is designed to be completed through the jupyter notebooks IDE.It is highly recommended that you use the Anaconda Distribution.The following libraries were used:
* NumPy
* pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## Summary of Findings

My analysis indicates that popularity of movies has been drastically increasing since the 80s.Therefore,this is likely a good time to make movies as appetite is high.Revenue and profit from movies has gone down particulaly between the 80s to the early 2000s since the 60s and the 70s although popularity of movies has been increasing.Analysis of average budget cost indicate that average budget costs shot up during the same period that revenue went down.It is possible that the increase in production cost affected the profits negatively.The most popular genres across the years have continued to include Adventure,Action,Thriller,Comedy and Drama.Therefore,production companies are advised to make more of the abovementioned genres in order to mantain the popularity in movies.The most profitable release months over the decades are May,June,July,November and December.This is likely because May to July are Summer holiday months in the Nothern hemisphere while November and December hosts prominent holiday months and it is during holiday seasons when most people consume movies. Therefore,production companies are advised to aim to release their movies during the holiday months.

## Key Limitations

Over half of the rows were dropped due to missing values and this likely affected the results.The cast,the directors and production companies were not included.The popularity of these may affect popularity and profitability of a movie.
